# headhunter.nvim

A Neovim plugin that helps you quickly **navigate and resolve merge conflicts** with customizable keybindings.

---

## âœ¨ Features

- Jump directly to the **next or previous conflict** in your repository.
- Quickly resolve conflicts using simple keybindings:
  - **Take HEAD** (`<<<<<<< HEAD`) â€“ keeps your local changes.
  - **Take origin** (`>>>>>>> ...`) â€“ keeps the incoming changes.
  - **Take both** â€“ keeps both changes, concatenated in order.
- Minimal and fast â€” pure Lua implementation with no external dependencies.
- Fully customizable keybindings to fit your workflow.

## ðŸ“¦ Installation

### Using [lazy.nvim](https://github.com/folke/lazy.nvim)

```lua
{
  "StackInTheWild/headhunter.nvim",
  lazy = true,
  opts = {
     register_keymaps = false, -- Disable internal keymaps if using lazy.nvim keys
  },
  keys = {
    { "]g", "<cmd>HeadhunterNext<cr>", desc = "Go to next Conflict" },
    { "[g", "<cmd>HeadhunterPrevious<cr>", desc = "Go to previous Conflict" },
    { "<leader>gh", "<cmd>HeadhunterTakeHead<cr>", desc = "Take changes from HEAD" },
    { "<leader>go", "<cmd>HeadhunterTakeOrigin<cr>", desc = "Take changes from origin" },
    { "<leader>gb", "<cmd>HeadhunterTakeBoth<cr>", desc = "Take both changes" },
  },
}
```

## ðŸš€ Usage

Assuming you are using the keybindings from above:

### Navigate Conflicts

- `[g` â†’ Jump to the previous conflict.
- `]g` â†’ Jump to the next conflict.

### Resolve Conflicts

Given a conflict block like this:

```
<<<<<<< HEAD
my changes
=======
their changes
>>>>>>> branch
```

| Action      | Keybinding   | Command                 | Resulting Text in Buffer        |
| ----------- | ------------ | ----------------------- | ------------------------------- |
| Take HEAD   | `<leader>gh` | `:HeadhunterTakeHead`   | `my changes`                    |
| Take origin | `<leader>go` | `:HeadhunterTakeOrigin` | `their changes`                 |
| Take both   | `<leader>gb` | `:HeadhunterTakeBoth`   | `my changes`<br>`their changes` |

_Notes:_

- Take HEAD keeps only your local changes.
- Take origin keeps only the incoming changes from the other branch.
- Take both concatenates your changes with the incoming changes, in that order.
